# History of Node.js on a Timeline

原文：https://blog.risingstack.com/history-of-node-js/

We’ve been publishing [articles on Node.js](https://blog.risingstack.com/articles/) for over a year now, and since [2015 was quite a year for Node.js](https://blog.risingstack.com/what-is-nodejs-used-for-the-2015-nodejs-overview-report/), we thought it’d be interesting to look back at what exactly happened to Node.js so far, from the point where it was born. 

**This is the history of Node.js on a timeline, from 2009 until now (December 2015)**:
